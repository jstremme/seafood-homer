At the end of the week,

Iowa shakes off the cold,

and we are met on Thursday

with eleven deer in one day:

three running through the yard,

two behind the tennis court after work,

five, a family, quiet in the woods

beside the trail we walk at dusk,

one alone, in the last of the sunlight.

Friday, rain ushers in heat.

On a dark morning,

we work just until noon

and listen to the fingers

tapping on the window,

sounding an explanation

for the cloudy sky,

sustaining the light

from three lamps

in soft orange.

In this way

the early morning

and all associated reflection

lingers for hours.
