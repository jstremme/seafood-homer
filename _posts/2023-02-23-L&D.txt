Waiting for the day you come home

I walk the hospital corridors

past our attempts to thwart the end

named, studied, practiced.

I imagine a sick man wandering the hallways

past the paintings, sculptures, and photographs

presented, perhaps to him,

as a summary.

Before there were blood transfusions

there were tribal masks.

That both should serve him now

brings me to the mystery of your life.

On every floor, every day, people part.

On the sixth floor they arrive from nowhere.
