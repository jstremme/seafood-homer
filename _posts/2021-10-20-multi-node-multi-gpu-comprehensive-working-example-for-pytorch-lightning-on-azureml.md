With the permission of my company, OptumLabs, I wrote a comprehensive Medium blog post on multi-node multi-GPU training for PyTorch Lightning on AzureML.  You can check it out at [this link](https://medium.com/@joelstremmel22/multi-node-multi-gpu-comprehensive-working-example-for-pytorch-lightning-on-azureml-bde6abdcd6aa). I hope the guide is useful to ML practitioners and researchers alike.  Feel free to leave comments on Medium.  Thanks in advance for any feedback!
