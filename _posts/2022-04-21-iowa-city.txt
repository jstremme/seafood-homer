We will remember the rain from these days,

and the long curls of smoke trapped for a moment

behind our screened in porch.

We will remember the drives through corn fields

to Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota,

and the new adventures to Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City.

Between drinks on Tuesday nights,

and the occasional weekend rounds at

St. Burch, Sanctuary, Deadwood,

George’s, and the Foxhead Tavern,

we work harder than ever.

I wake in the night from dreams of dark caverns,

lighted faintly by the shine of white bone,

human and animal skulls strewn down a narrow passage,

where a young woman runs every day after work.

I take a deep breath when I see your face against the pillow.

By 7:30 I always feed the cats and begin writing.

We will remember the starting and ending of these days,

the five minutes of *Writer’s Almanac*,

the thirty minutes of *Seinfeld*.

All while the house plants and bushes,

trees, flowers, and vegetables

slowly take a little more space.

We too like the light

creeping up the branches of the Oak tree

stretch out and become the background

against which we first saw ourselves as new and different.

We are at the point where we never go to the same places again

without a smile of familiarity.

We will remember the roots and faces and sadness here,

the times we were afraid of how much we need each other.
