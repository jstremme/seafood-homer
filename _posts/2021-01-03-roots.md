I spent years away from you,

And buried thousands of hours of thoughts

Below the surface of your being,

Deep where I thought you were not.


Then, on a dark day,

On a tree-covered path,

I noticed the roots of the trees

Were so strong

That they rose from below

And shattered the bricks of the path,

Breaking the seal that held them straight.
