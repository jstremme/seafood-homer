I listen to the still house,

The birds calling in the morning fog,

The world swelling in my mind,

Taking hold of my senses.

&nbsp;

It takes incredible willpower to allow these entrances.

So often I am pulling threads from myself,

Stretching them out over the earth to fill it

And be seen in bright colors, expertly woven.

&nbsp;

Today I will be called again to say something,

But this morning I make myself empty and become everything,

The boundary between myself and the world

Like a kitchen doorway on a hinge,

&nbsp;


Freely opening and closing to mingle the smells

And allow the meal to be prepared and delivered.
