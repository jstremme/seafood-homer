Last Saturday I was thinking back to some of the films I watched in college.  "The New World" by Terrence Malick stuck out in my mind.  I recall my friend sharing that Malick took years to plan out his films.   Indeed, he's been a director for years but released few movies over his long career ([Malick's filmography here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrence_Malick#Filmography)), especially given his success.
